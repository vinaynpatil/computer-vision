Challenge1b (Additional Property)
----------------------------------
Along with the 6 properties requested, I have computed an additional rectangular bounded area property, which can be seen as the 7th property in db.

Challenge1c
-----------
For this challenge to recognize the objects, I have made use of the combination of roundness and bounded area properties.
Using just the roundness seemed to be insufficient for some images and hence I resorted to using the above 2 properties together.

I observed that the absolute roundness threshold of 0.03 and the absolute bounded area threshold of 600 units seem to work the best for recognition as seen in the output images.
